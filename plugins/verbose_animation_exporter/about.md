# Verbose Animation Exporter

A simple BlockBench plugin whose purpose is to export animations neatly for later use. This includes animation keyframes, easings (as well as arguments tied to them), and metadata. Additionally, this plugin allows for models to be exported in its own format.

Unlike other animation utilities/exporters, this plugin isn't tied to a specific library; it was initially made for use in Chaos Awakens and Live Player Reaction, but later generalised for reusability. 

Mod developers are free to work with this plugin based on their own needs.
